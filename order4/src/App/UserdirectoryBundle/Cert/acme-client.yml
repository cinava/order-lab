    # For each certificate, there are a few options.
    #
    # Required: paths
    # Optional: bits, user
    #
    # paths: Map of document roots to domains. Maps each path to one or multiple
    #        domains. If one domain is given, it's automatically converted to an
    #        array. The first domain will be the common name.
    #
    #        The client will place a file into $path/.well-known/acme-challenge/
    #        to verify ownership to the CA
    #
    # bits:  Number of bits for the domain private key
    #
    # user:  User running the web server. Challenge files are world readable,
    #        but some servers might require to be owner of files they serve.
    #
    # rekey: Regenerate certificate key pairs even if a key pair already exists.
    #
