All users associated with the project (project's submitter, all types of investigators, pathologists involved, contacts)
will receive a notification email when the project is created, content updated, or status changed.
These project's PIs and billing contact are automatically pre-populated on the new work request creation page; however, they can be modified by the submitter.

Work request's submitter will receive all emails associated with this work request (all updates or all status changes).
Work request's principal investigators for the project and billing contact
will receive a notification email only when the work request is canceled or completed.

Of course, there are all kind of internal emails send to the TRP admins, project's reviewers and technicians.

We have the workflow diagram shown here https://view.med.cornell.edu/translational-research/workflow/project-requests. In order to have a final approval, the project must pass 4 project's stages in this order:
IRB Review -> Admin Review -> Committee Review -> Final Review
There is only one exception for admins - Admin can skip all stages and provide the final approval ("Approve project request" button on the action menu).

You can review the project only on the review page by clicking the "Approve", "Reject", "Request additional information" buttons.
The project moves to the next stage only if "Approve" button is clicked.
Also, as MISI admin, you can provide a final approval for the project and skip all stages by clicking the "Approve project request".
In this case only the project's associated users (submitter, PIs, contacts) will receive the notification email.
All reviewers for skipped stages will not receive the notification emails.
