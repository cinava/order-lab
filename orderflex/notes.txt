### Migrating to 3.4, adapt the source code: ###
1)Rename namespaces and DB's entityNameSpace to App
2) Replace entitynamespace Oleg to App in Document.php, FosComment.php, GeneralEntity.php, Logger.php and all lists (enough to execute SQL1 and SQL2))
UPDATE public.user_logger SET entitynamespace = REPLACE(entitynamespace,'Oleg','App');
UPDATE public.user_foscomment SET entitynamespace = REPLACE(entitynamespace,'Oleg','App');
UPDATE public.user_generalentity SET entitynamespace = REPLACE(entitynamespace,'Oleg','App');
UPDATE public.user_document SET entitynamespace = REPLACE(entitynamespace,'Oleg','App');
UPDATE * SET entitynamespace = REPLACE(entitynamespace,'Oleg','App') WHERE entitynamespace IS NOT NULL AND entitynamespace LIKE '%Oleg%';

### Migrating to 3.4 Flex: ###
#use branch v3.4.flex: git push -u origin v3.4.flex
1) create new Symfony skeleton
2) Merge yaml config
3) Move original templates from app/Resources/views/ to templates/
4) Merge app_*.php
### Migrating to 4: ###
1) Remove Assetic:
{% stylesheets
   'bundles/oleguserdirectory/bootstrap/css/*'
   'bundles/oleguserdirectory/form/css/form.css'
%}
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="{{ asset_url }}" />
{% endstylesheets %}
Replace stylesheets by
<link href="{{ asset('bootstrap/css/*') }}" rel="stylesheet" />
<link href="{{ asset('form/css/form.css') }}" rel="stylesheet" />
2) {% for titleInfo in headInfoArr.titleInfo if titleInfo.name is defined %}

Fix: convert input to string (AbstractLexer.php adding line $input = $input."";)

######### Solution: ##############
1) Copy AbstractLexer to src/App/Doctrine\Common\Lexer\AbstractLexer

Add tag locally: git tag -a -m "symfony v 4.4.2 and php 7.4.1 without calendar bundle" sf4.4-php7.4
Push tag to remote: git push origin sf4.4-php7.4

I) Rename master to sf3.4-php5.6 and create a new master from sf4-php7
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2862590/how-to-replace-master-branch-in-git-entirely-from-another-branch):
1) git branch -m master master-old  # rename master on local (master-old is sf3.4-php5.6)
2) git push origin :master          # delete master on remote (git push -f origin :master)
3) git push origin master-old       # create master-old on remote
4) git checkout -b master seotweaks # create a new local master on top of seotweaks
5) git push origin master           # create master on remote

II) Error: failed to push some refs to ... (https://matthew-brett.github.io/pydagogue/gh_delete_master.html):
1) First you delete master in your local clone. To do this we first make a new branch called placeholder or similar, and delete master from there:
git branch placeholder
git checkout placeholder
2) push up the placeholder branch:
git checkout placeholder # if not on placeholder already
git push origin placeholder
3) Then set placeholder to be the github default branch.
Go to the main github page for your forked repository, and click on the “Admin” button.
There’s a “Default branch” dropdown list near the top of the screen.
From there, select placeholder.
On the interface I’m looking at, a green tick appears above the dropdown list. Now you can do (from the command line):
4) Delete master
git push origin :master
5) Continue on I(3)

Rename master-new to master on local and remote:
0) Create master-new (sf5). When ready to switch master-new to master:
1a) In master: git branch -m master master-old                  # rename master-old on local (master-old to master)
1b) In master-new: git branch -m master-new master              # rename master on local (master-new to master)
2) Set default branch on github to master-new in admin panel
3) git push origin :master                                      # delete master on remote (git push -f origin :master)
4) git push -f origin master                                    # push local branch master (master-new) to remote master
5) git push origin --delete sf5                                 # delete duplicate branch sf5

After renaming remote branch, git pull to local:
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/{{your branch name}}

Clone specific branch:
git clone --single-branch --branch <branchname> <remote-repo-url>
git clone --single-branch --branch <tag_name> <remote-repo-url>
git clone --single-branch --branch sf4-php7 https://github.com/victorbrodsky/order-lab.git

Generate DigitalOcean:
Symfony 4.4 with PHP 7.4:
1) Create a new folder Test1
2) git clone --single-branch --branch sf4-php7 https://github.com/victorbrodsky/order-lab.git
3) cd order-lab/packer
4) bash deploy-order-digital-ocean.sh --token yourapitoken --os centos

Symfony 3.4 with PHP 5.6:
1) Create a new folder Test1
2) git clone --single-branch --branch sf3.4-php5.6-windows https://github.com/victorbrodsky/order-lab.git
3) cd order-lab/packer
4) bash deploy-order-digital-ocean.sh --token yourapitoken --os centos

Some folks at NYP also have WCM roles which would give them AD accounts. 
It sounds like they need a new role sponsored by someone at WCM. Anyone designated as an administrator of the department/division you wish for them to have a role under can submit a new identity request using our affiliate role system.
You can see the administrators on the tab of the same name on the department/division page in our web directory. Example page: https://directory.weill.cornell.edu/departments/1851100000

Composer update:
Argument 1 passed to App\OrderformBundle\Form\CustomType\ScanCustomSelectorType::__construct() must be an instance of
Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager, instance of Doctrine\ORM\EntityManager given

https://github.com/doctrine/orm/issues/8242:
To anyone getting stuck with this,
Just use "doctrine/common":"^2.13" till package is upgraded along with whole eco-system and gets full compatibility.
It installed orm version 2.7.3 which is stable release at the moment of writing. took me a quite while to figure out why packages aren't in sync even in LTS / stable channel.

Reinstall stof/doctrine-extensions-bundle with Symfony4 support
composer remove antishov/doctrine-extensions-bundle
composer require stof/doctrine-extensions-bundle

Solution:
Replaced Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager by Doctrine\ORM\EntityManagerInterface in __construct(EntityManagerInterface $em ...)

git push origin master
git push originme master
git push bitbucket master

Aperio:
The procedure is complicated and requires manually editing the Aperio settings or the source code and it requires admin permission to modify the files.
One way is to edit E:\Program Files (x86)\Aperio\DataServer\Authentication\Core.DataServer.LDAPIntf.dll file:
    Change DistinguishedName to: DistinguishedName="CN=cwid,CN=Users,DC=a,DC=wcmc-ad,DC=net" SearchFilter="(objectClass=user)"
    In the right lower corner of the desktop: Stop/Start DataServer process in the Aperio eSlide Manager icon.
    Change DistinguishedName back to: DistinguishedName="ou=NYP Users,ou=External,DC=a,DC=wcmc-ad,DC=net" SearchFilter="(objectClass=user)"
    Stop/Start Aperio "Data Server"
    Add user by cwid
Repeat 1-2 for other users to be added.
Second way (not recommended) is temporary replace the EditUser.php to the similar custom file which I wrote for this purpose.
In my opinion, Aperio does not use the optimized add new user interface which is trying to show all users from the active directory in the "LDAP user name" field. The branch "CN=Users" has 29764 users and I think it is choking the system and it gives an error "DataServer: returned malformed XML". Currently DistinguishedName is set to "ou=NYP Users,ou=External" and it's working with this branch because it has only with 2247 users. However, it shows only the users in this branch.
If it would be possible to re-configure DistinguishedName  to search both branches, then the best way to solve this issue is to replace the EditUser.php and associated files with the custom files and do not show the list of all users in the active directory branches.
Last step assign permission: User Groups -> Faculty -> add user -> Save
